# Consistency Is Key
Simple bare bones productivity app for myself and anyone else who would be interested in using it.
It will have a simple and clean UI.
There will be no sign-up or subscription, by extension no advertizement emails will be sent to you.
Premium version will be a flat fee payed once (sales tax may vary).
No need for internet connection.
Notifications will only be there for encouragement and not to advertize.

This app is going to be open source, so anyone can use the source code and see it. Despite this, I am going to monetize it for shits and giggles.
